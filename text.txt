#Descrption of project:

Searching for the gifts 
We have five boxes, where one of them contains a hidden gift.
The user clicks on one random box. If this box contains a gift,
the website shows “You win in X steps, where X is the number of clicks on the boxes.
When the user clicks on box without gift, the code increase X with one. 

Now, X contains zero value. When the user clicks on the first box, this box contains no gift.
Therefore, the value of X increases with one. 
The user tries and clicks on the third box that contains the hidden gift. 
Therefore, the site shows the message “You win in 2 steps”. 

 
The students will: 

design this game. 

allow the user to select the number of boxes and draw the new game. 

set the hidden gift in one random box. 

allow the user to click on any box.
